# AwesomeEHR 🏥

## Overview
AwesomeEHR is a sophisticated SQL-based framework designed for comprehensive analysis of Electronic Health Records (EHR) data. This project focuses on the analysis and prediction of critical medical conditions, particularly:

- **Metabolic Disorders** 🔬:
  - Acidosis
  - Hypoglycemia
  - Electrolyte imbalances
  - Malnutrition

- **Organ System Dysfunction** 💉:
  - Central Nervous System (CNS) dysfunction
  - Hepatic dysfunction
  - Renal dysfunction
  - Coagulation disorders

- **Respiratory and Cardiovascular Conditions** ❤️:
  - Oxygen transport deficiency
  - Myocardial ischemia
  - Tachycardia
  - Hypocarbia

- **Other Critical Conditions** ⚕️:
  - Cholecystitis
  - Leukocyte dysfunction
  - Thermoregulatory disorders
  - Urine output abnormalities

The framework facilitates the extraction, transformation, and analysis of complex medical data across multiple clinical domains, including vital signs, laboratory results, medications, and patient demographics, with a particular focus on early detection and monitoring of these critical conditions.
